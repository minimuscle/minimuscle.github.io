				<p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>“Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.</li>

				<p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).</p>
				<!-- INSERT OTHER USES OF DEVICE INFORMATION, INCLUDING:  ADVERTISING/RETARGETING -->
