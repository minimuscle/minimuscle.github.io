					<p><strong>Name:</strong> Josh Thiele
					<br/><strong>Student Number: </strong>s3717991
					<br/><strong>Email Address: </strong>s3717991@student.rmit.edu.au
					<br/><br/><strong>Culture:</strong>
					<br/>I have lived my entire life in Victoria, Australia, leaving the state only a few times in my whole life. I have holidayed in Queensland, and I have travelled to the US for the Vex Robotics World Champions in 2016. This trip was a large eye opener as it was my first experience of a culture that was no my own, to which I absolutely loved the new culture and it's people. It made me much more interested about possibly spending time in another country for school and for work.

					<p><strong>Education:</strong>
					<br/>I went to primary school at Woodlands Primary School, and completed most of my high school at Hillcrest Christian College. During my time at the college I found out who I was as a person. Due to financial issues, I moved to Frankston High School where I completed my Year 12 VCE Certificate.
					<br/><br/><strong>Language:</strong>
					<br/>Whilst I cannot speak any other language aside from English fluently, I have been learning German at a low pace since I was 14. At this stage, I am able to understand basic words and pre-set questions, as well as understand a word or two within a song. I am much better at reading than writing or listening / speaking. This makes it hard for me to be able to leave the country to a place that does not speak majorily English, such as China.

					<strong>Pets:</strong>
					<br/>My family owns 3 pets, I own one of them. We own two cats and a Quaker Parrot. The two cats are 10 and 5 years old. Our Quaker Parrot's name is Meelo. I have had him for almost 2 years now, and he is starting to talk more often now. He is able to sing along to songs and has a very funny personality.
					<br/><br/><strong>Hobbies:</strong>
					<br/>I spend much of my time on my PC. I use my PC to play games a lot, mainly City-Builder games such as SimCity 2013 and Cities: Skylines, but I also like to play strategic and sandbox games like Factorio, and Civilization V. I also love to play board games, I have joined the SFGA at RMIT University where I play various board games and Dungeons and Dragons
