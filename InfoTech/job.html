					</header>
					<h3></h3>
					<h3>Position</h3>
					<p>The position is for a Senior Software Developer/Engineer. This is a position where large amounts of experience is necessary in order to be accepted into this position. This role involes working with a team on back-end tasks for the company CyTrack. This includes web services, application integration, and API intergration and development. The role also requires the ability to assist in customer support at a high level, meaning only challenging issues that cannot be solved by the customer support team that are dedicated to that job. The role also involves troubleshooting both the existing systems and new 3rd party applications that may be added into the system in the future.</p>
					<p>This position is appealing to me because I am interested in working in a team with others on a high level of complexity. I also get the chance to work both with the functionality of the company itself, as well as the customer base, even if only at the high level. This eliminates the repitition of the low level customer support and it also keeps the challenge as a senior developer / engineer.</p>
					<h3>Skills and Experience</h3>
					<p>A large range of skills are required to be qualified for this task. A knowledge of the following is needed or highly recommended:
						<ul>
							<li>C#</li>
							<li>Visual C++</li>
							<li>Microsoft SQL</li>
							<li>Understanding of Object-Orientated-Programming Concepts</li>
							<li>Understanding of Serialisation Protocals Such as XML and JSON</li>
							<li>Skills to Get to Root Cause of Technical Issues</li>
							<li>Broad API and SDK Experience</li>
							<li>Cloud Computing Knowledge</li>
						</ul>
						This large list requires many years of practice in order to become to adept in all of these areas, specifically with C#, C++, SQL and OOP Programming.
					</p>
					<p>These skills are all common skills many developers gather along their career. Mastery of each of the skills takes a long time meaning that only the most dedicated to their career will have the knowledge to gain this position, this allows the company to ensure that they will only gather the correct people for the job.</p>
					<h3>Current Skills and Experience</h3>
					<p>Currently, I have skills in a few of these areas. I have a basic understanding of C#, C++ and Java, allowing me to be able to easily pick up on new items introduced to me along my journey to learn more. I also have used SQL and XML to a limited extent. I am able to assist with low level and even some more complex mid-tier technical issues and hardware issues due to my background in computers, and my hobby of fixing them for friends and family.</p>
					<h3>Plan to Obtain These Skills</h3>
					<p>By finishing University, I should have a solid grasp of Java and perhaps other Object-Orientated-Programming languages. I will have an understanding of XML and a more broadened knowledge of cloud computing. I can also gain more experience in hardware fixing by completing my CompTIA A+, Security+ and Network+ Certificates in my spare time after university. The rest of the skills can be obtained during my time in the workforce practicing each of my skills to get better at each and one to become a more experienced programmer in general.</p>
