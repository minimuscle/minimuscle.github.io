					<h3>Overview:</h3>
					<p>LingChat will be a Multi-Language chat service where people from all over the world will be able to talk to each other, regardless of the language of one's origin. LingChat will mainly be a chat client, but will host a variety of other ways to learn a language too. Users will be able to set their native language, and to choose their own target language. They will then be paired with someone who naturally speaks that language, and wants to learn their native. Users will also be able to talk to Bots in the case there is no one available. Chat will act much like a messenger application.</p>
					
					<h3>Motivation:</h3>
					<p>LingChat was inspired by my love for Germany. While looking for a suiting chatting site for an international electronic version of a “pen-pal”, I found there was no good alternative. Either it was extremely expensive, or slow and outdated. I loved the idea of My Language Exchange, but without a pro version, it wasn’t possible to talk really.  59% of the EU learn a second language in school, with many of these countries learning 3 or more; many Chinese and Japanese people learn English as well. To overcome that barrier to language learning, that is, to go from reading and writing formally, to texting informally, LingChat provides the learners with this knowledge.</p>
					
					<h3>Description:</h3>
					<p>LingChat is first and foremost a language chat application. People from all over the world will be able to talk to each other in the language they choose, eliminating the language barrier. To achieve this, LingChat offers a couple of ways, and it ranges from beginner to advanced. LingChat will have 3 main features:</p>
					<div class="image right">
							<img src="images/group.png" alt="Friends"/>
					</div>
					<ol>
						<li>Chat – Random chats with strangers across the globe.</li>
						<li>Friends – Added friends that are common chat buddies.</li>
						<li>Bots – Bots to help a user develop their skills when no one is online.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Firstly, when the user signs up for the service, they will be prompted to select their native language and country of origin, as well as their target language for learning. They can state the level of the target language knowledge (Using the CEFR System, A1-C2). They will also be able to set a short bio to describe themselves to other users.
					The user can then search for other users using the app, they can search through Country, Language, Age, CEFR Level, etc. Once a match has been found, the user can start a conversation. Ideally, the user should start talking in his/her target language and be able to speak at the level of complexity that the other user can understand what they are saying.
					From there, the user can then chat in either language about whatever they desire, and hints can be given to keep the conversation going.</p>
					<p>LingChat will implement a function that can help the user to translate a sentence, if either user does not understand. Using the integrated API (Google Translate), a user can translate the sentence. While this may not be perfect, it will provide a rough idea of what the other user is trying to say.
					If the user is not proficient enough in the language he/she is speaking, a message will be sent to the receiver acknowledging the fact.  It will prompt the receiver that the translation may not work correctly due to this fact. This will help to avoid any mistaken insults due to poor wording or incorrect spelling. </p>
					<p>Secondly, the users will be able to make ‘friends’. One of the options in the chat screen will be to add the selected user as a friend. This moves their profile to a separate section, where the user knows that they are speaking more frequently. Both members need to add as a friend to go to this section. They will also be able to see more information, such as birthday and country, if the user wishes to display these settings.</p>
					<p>Finally, the users will be able to talk to bots. Users will not be online in every language at every time of the day. Because of time zones, many countries will be sleeping when others are awake, such as the US and Australia. Bots are a good way to keep the user happy while they wait. They will be available to chat in multiple languages at different levels, from A1-B2 (C1+C2 Will not be available in bots).</p>

					</div>
					<h3>Tools and Technologies:</h3>
					<p>The software used to be created by scratch. The PC version and the Android will be the first to be developed due to compatibility with the code, however, the iOS version will have to be rewritten in Objective C, which will take more time. LingChat will be largely client side with the bots and chats hosted on the client, however, servers will need to be used to host the connection to the other users and for messages to be sent and received. 
					</p>
					<p>LingChat’s bots will be open to the community to add and contribute. Community members will be able to help to the language and to create a better bot for the users. It will also help the team as less languages need to be known at the app’s creation.</p>
					<h3>Skills Required</h3>
					<p>LingChat requires a range of skills to complete the project:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>A Graphic Designer – to design the app and website design for the app to make it appealing</li>
						<li>A Programmer – to program the app in whatever programming language is decided for Android and windows</li>
						<li>Objective-C Programmer – to program the app for iOS</li>
						<li>Speakers in Multiple Languages – to help with bots and translations. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>these skills, the project should be possible. A team manager will also need to be present, as they will deal with any hardware requirements, meaning they will need knowledge of servers and the hardware requirements.
						It should be relatively easy to find all of these skills, although the fluent speakers may take more time.
					</p>
					<h3>Outcome</h3>
					<p>If LingChat were to be successful, thousands of people all around the world would now be connected, and the language barrier would be a thing of the past. The original problem of speaking to others in another language will  not longer be an issue, with users being able to speak in any language they desire, to whoever they want. It will allow people interested in learning a language, but unable to develop further passed sites like Duolingo and Memrise, the ability to take it to the next step becoming B1 proficient.</p>
