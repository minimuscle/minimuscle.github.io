					<h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
					<p>The Entertainer - ESFP-T</p>
					</header>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Entertainer types are spontanious, energetic and enthusiastic people. They can get caught up in the moment, but they want everyone else to feel that way too. They have the most time generous personsality and can be extremely encouraging towards others. Entertainers can become so focused on the immediate pleasures that they can often neglect the tasks that make those luxuries possible. Entertainers can also recognise value and quality when they see it, this however, can lead to them living beyond the capabilities, such as spending too much.</p>

					</div>
					<h4>Meaning for Me</h4>
					<p>To me, the Entertainer personality reveals what I feel on a subconscious level. It sees past what I am on the outside, to who I want to be in the future, who I am on the inside. This shows that although every single part of this personality may not be 100% accurate to who I am, it follows me roughly correctly, and can help other people who know about this type to accommodate me and my personality. The result also tells me that my dreams of doing certain things may one day be a reality, as they follow this personality and accommodate for them in my day-to-day routine.</p>
					<h4>Influence Behaviour in a Team</h4>
					<p>I believe that these results show a direct corelation between my personality and how I work as a team. It shows that I enjoy working with a good team and can get bored working by myself, which is definitely true. Although I do like having alone time like most people, I love to work with others at tasks even if the work doesn't necessarily need to be done in teams. I also believe that if others knew the personality type within the team itself, it could help to understand the role I take and how to accommodate that role into the team work that will benefit the team overall.</p>
					<h4>Forming a Team</h4>
					<p>I believe that this can also have an effect when forming a team. People with opposing personalities may clash and render the team not as effective due to the mixed personalities. Shy people who are afraid to speak up may have a hard time voicing their opinion when I am in the group due to my urge to take control of the conversation and keep it going, even if that sometimes means not letting an opposing personality have a voice. It can also have the opposite effect, where complimentary personalaities will ensure that the team works even better that it would normally, with each person having an equal say in how the team operates and in voicing their opinion.</p>

					<h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
					<p>Audiory</p>
					</header>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>Auditory learners lean by hearing and listening. It means that they can understand and remember things that they have heard. They store information by the way it sounds and they have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. They often learn by reading out loud because they have to hear it or speak it in order to know it. Auditory learners often hum or talk to themselves or others when they become bored. Many people may think that they are not paying attention, even though they may be hearing and understanding everything that is being said.</p>
					<div class="image right">
						<img src="images/auditory-learner.png" alt="Auditory Learner" style="width: 300px" />
					</div>
					<h4>Meaning for Me</h4>
					<p>For me, the auditory learning style means that to understand something, it needs to be heard. This means that attending lectures is benefitcial and the physcial sound of explaining may help solve any issues I have with not understanding something. It also means that I must seek physical help through face-to-face meetings rather than through email or non-verbal contact methods.</p>
					<h4>Influence Behaviour in a Team</h4>
					<p>I believe that it may influence my behaviour in the team as I am more likely to request that the other team members verbally express what they are doing and how they are changing specific items in the project or assignment. It will also mean that it may require more time for face-to-face meetups rather than over the internet texting and at-home working. This would require more effort from everyone in the team.</p>
					<h4>Forming a Team</h4>
					<p>I do not believe this will have too much effect on the formation of my teams, although it may effect the decision if they are shy and unwilling to talk, or too hard to understand what they are trying to say verbally, but other factors in that are also key and may prevent them from joining the team anyway so ultimately I believe that it will not be a major problem in the formation of a team. However, it may be an issue if a person within the team is unwilling to verbally discuss items, making it hard for face-to-face meetings.</p>

						<h3>Big Five Personality Test</h3>
						<p>5 Factor Personality Test</p>
					</header>
					<h4>Introduction</h4>
					<p>The big five personality traits are the best accepted and most commonly used model of personality in academic psychology. The big five come from the statistical study of responses to personality items. Using a technique called factor analysis researchers can look at the responses of people to hundreds of personality items and ask the question "what is the best was to summarize an individual?". This has been done with many samples from all over the world and the general result is that, while there seem to be unlimited personality variables, five stand out from the pack in terms of explaining a lot of a persons answers to questions about their personality: extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience. The big-five are not associated with any particular test, a variety of measures have been developed to measure them. This test uses the Big-Five Factor Markers from the International Personality Item Pool, developed by Goldberg (1992).</p>

					</div>
					<h4>Meaning for Me</h4>
					<p>The meaning of this test for me is not as relevant as the other two. The test looks to base huge personality traits based on a few limited number of questions. This test described my emtional stability in the 5th percentile, well below where I believe I would be. Each part puts my in a low percentile, which leads me to believe that this test is not very accurate.</p>
					<h4>Influence Behaviour in a Team</h4>
					<p>Due to my previous statement, I do not believe that this test's results will influence my behaviour within a team. I do not belueve that I am in line with many of the points, even the positive ones, to the extreme the test seems to suggest. This means that when working in a team, items such as the emotional stability would not be a factor as the work does not even require emotional attachment most of the time. It also suggests that I have low imagination which would normally be detrimental to the success of the assignment.</p>
					<h4>Forming a Team</h4>
					<p>This will not have any effect on the formation of my team because the results do not mean much to me personally. I believe that I have the power to control how I behave and how I act in public and in a group and that my actions are different in the scenarios than when I am by myself or in a different situation such as a work event or family event.</p>
