					<p><strong>Start of IT Career:</strong>
					<br/>My interest in IT has been with me for as long as I can remember. One of my earliest memories is sitting on the family computer playing the game Pyjama Sam: No Need to Hide When it's Dark Outside. A game of problem solving. Games like this, and many others filled my time inside.
					</p><p>Of course, as I got older, my interest in the computer itself exploded. By the time I was in year 5, I knew just as much about the computer as the IT teacher, who was little more than a librarian in realality. I spent time in the Senior School's computer lab working on programs that any normal kid would find boring. But I loved it.

						<p>By the time I was in year 7, I had discovered programming. I quickly learned how to make a basic quiz with Visual Basic in Visual Studio, which my school had in the library. Around year 8 I figured out how to make a website, and from then on, my programming interest was ever-growing. I would later spend hours upon hours working on my year 12 final project in Visual Basic. I probably spent 10x more than anyone else in that class, but it was worth it, because afterwards I not only came out with the top mark, but 100% in all but one area, encryption (I forgot to write about it, as that was all that was needed). 
					</p>

						<strong>Interest in IT:</strong>
						<br/>As you may have gathered in the previous section, one of my interests in IT is programming, but that is not all. I do love to program, but I am also facinated with the hardware. When I was 14, I spent over $2500 to build my own custom PC. This very PC is the same one I use now, albeit with a few RAM upgrades and 3 much better monitors (previously on an old 4:3 480p screen).
						</p>
						<p>I spent much time looking at the ins and outs of Windows, and even dabbled in Linux, although my PC still refuses to run it for whatever reason. I now fix computers and have a heavy interest in the hardware of the computers, I spent time learning about how they work. Spread through word of mouth, I own a business where I fix computers for cheap prices. It is quite successful but with univerist and work, I do not have much time left to persure this passion.

						<strong>RMIT University:</strong>
						<br/>I chose to come to RMIT for many reasons. First of all, RMIT has one of the best names when it comes to technology. It is also one of the best univiersities in Victoria. I knew I wouldn't be able to get straight into the course I wanted, but I also knew RMIT was the best option as they had many other IT courses, unlike Monash, which only had the one. I finally got in to the course that is easy to change if I do well in and shares many courses.
					</p><p> Within my time at RMIT, I expect to learn how to use softwate and to program that is essential to my career as an IT professional. I should be able to complete tasks that require the use of IT such as programming, or UNIX development and use of the terminal in MacOS, Linux and Windows.
